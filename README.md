_actual documentation below_ 

## File structure
In trying to keep the file structure as similar to the 2022 commandrobot structure, we have the following files:

- subsystems
    - DriveSubsystem

- commands
    - Auto | Test command for following paths
    - DefaultDrive | This is the code used for controller based driving
